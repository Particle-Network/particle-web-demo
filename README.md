Particle Auth is a simple self-custodial auth infra for Web3 apps and wallets. We support mobile number and email login, providing users with a simple operating experience. Their login account is then associated with a blockchain wallet, which is secured with a "Threshold Signatures vault".    

* Speedy logins: the log-in process is no different from that of a Web2.0 login, which greatly lowers the barriers to entry and improves user experience.
* Non-custodial private key infrastructure: Particle Network provides MPC (Multi-Party Computation)-based TSS (Threshold Signatures Scheme). With TSS, each party creates an independent key. They then forge the vault's lock together in a modular way, in which each party shapes a part of the lock that corresponds to its key. The user is always in control of ownership and access to their cryptographic key pair.
* Custom UI: customize Particle Auth's UI so that it blends directly into your application, you can brand in the Dashboard.
* Signature Service: a full signature service, including Send Transaction, Sign Message and so on. Your users can view the detailed data of each signature.
